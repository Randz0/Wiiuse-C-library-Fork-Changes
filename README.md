Quick little readme, but this fork exist from a local repos so it only tracks the files I edited/considered editing at one point or another

If you wanted to build this fork download the official library from www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=wiiuse+library&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 and compile it as normal, replacing the files with mine before building
